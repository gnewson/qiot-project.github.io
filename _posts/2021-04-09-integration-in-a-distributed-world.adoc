## What is Integration

```integration (noun) - "the process of bringing together the component sub-systems into one system ```

Integration unlocks the true potential of modern enterprises. Time and time again we see the same stories pop-up,
the likes of Uber, Air BnB, Amazon, Netflix. How these vastly different businesses used modern technologies and methodologies,
to massively distrupt their respective markets and outperform and outlast long standing companies.
We are seeing the value, and almost the neccesity that every company these days, should first and foremost be a "software company".

But being a software company will only get you so far. A company could be highly reliant on outdated, inefficient technology.
This will enventually become a burden, and the technology will not serve the company, but rather, the company will serve the technology. 

That's not a good position to be in.

So where does Integration come into play?

There are 3 points that are very apt here:
1. “Agility” is the most important business capability today
2. Every organization has integration problems to solve
3. Centralized doesn't scale




## Red Hat Integration

Red Hat have a number of products to solve your Integration problems, but the 3 main pillars, or product types, fall into the categories
of: Distributed Integration, Containers and APIs

### Distributed Integration

In all modern integration architectures we see a shift away from centralized integration. While a centralized integration
bus has a number of benefits, it is becoming less suitable to modern use cases. 100s of Applications are becomes 10,000s of microservices
Speed, agility and flexibility are key. With a heavy, cumbersome ESB, maintenance and management can be a headache as the ESB 
keeps getting larger and more complex with every service or data point that is added. With ESBs we have a smart pipe, with dumb endpoints.
We need to move towards dumb pipes and smart endpoints.

If we deploy our integration service across a distributed architecture it reduces the likelyhood of it becoming a bottleneck.
We can scale up and down much easier by adding new deployments or replicas to our services. We also gain added resiliancy
as a by-product, as (depending on the nature of our deployment), our service can be distributed across multiple clouds, datacenters,
or geos.


### Containers

Containerizing our services allows us massive portability and repeatability across multiple deployment targets. Openshift 
being Red Hat's Container Platform facilitates the distributed nature of our integration deployment, and any deployment for that matter.
OCP can be run across mulitple clouds, on RHEL or bare metal servers. And wherever OCP is, our Integration products can be deployed.

### APIs

API based integration is how we move from smart pipes to smart endpoints. We hand off responsibility to each service or data point
to create and uphold its API contract. This tells us how to interact with the service and what data formats and structures it expects.
The contracts themselves can be version controlled, allowing backwards compatibility with other older services while also creating and
exposing new APIs.

Once we have moved heavy business logic and communication contracts out of our integration layer, it can work much faster and more efficiently.


## Distributed World

What we see driving more need for a modern integration architecture is the world of IOT. Now instead of 10,000s of microservices we are 
seeing millions if not billions of connected devices, sensors, services. All collecting and sending data across your architecture.
And in this case especially 'Centralized Doesn't Scale'. This mantra applies not only to the architecture, but also to the people!

While a centralised Integration Team is highly efficient, it may not be agile. And sooner or later it will become a bottleneck.

How can we fix this?

In an ideal world, you can Do-It-Yourself. You don't need to wait for the integration team to build the API or transformation layer that
you need for your application. You can create it yourself, using Low-Code or No-Code tooling. Having this type of technology available
will greatly reduce the load on the centralised team, and also increase the agility speed and time-to-market of new applications and services.

While we mainly focus on the 3 main products in our Integration Bundle (Fuse, Openshift and 3scale), there are
mainy more products to accomplish a miriad of tasks and address specific problems with your integration architecture.
